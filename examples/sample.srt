1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
did you notice that Iman godi shut down

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,759
his marketing agency to start a SAS

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,600
business and Jordan Welch well he's all

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,280
about Drop Shipping but guess what he's

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,360
also diving into sass you see the

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,160
pattern here all the gurus on YouTube

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,240
and Tik Tok keep pushing dropshipping

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,720
and social media marketing agencies but

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,240
behind the scenes they're all switching

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,039
to SAS and there's a good reason for it

11
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,000
SAS is exploding right now and in 2025

12
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,640
it's way more profitable than the stuff

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,279
that most people are telling you to do

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,359
if you don't know what SAS is it stands

15
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,519
for software as a service here's how it

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,440
works you take a software that's already

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,120
built you put your own logo on it and

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,600
then you resell it as many times as you

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,920
want simple right but here's the kicker

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,120
you're still early there's only around

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,039
60,000 people worldwide that are

22
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,160
currently doing this getting in now is

23
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,840
like starting Drop Shipping back in 2010

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,079
it's a gold mine just waiting for you to

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,719
tap into and unlike all the other gurus
